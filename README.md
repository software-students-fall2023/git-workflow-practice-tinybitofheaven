This will have a **big** impact on game developemnt but also a lot of other general software development also. Game developers use a lot of external software in order to better integrate their processes and piplines into Unity Engine and if Unity becomes a liability for companies and indie devs to use these other software will also experience negative impacts. There really isn't an alternative game engine that fulfills the role Unity has had so far in the game development industry and even if they rollback these changes, they really did break their userbase's trust which will have long lasting impacts in the future.

I think that it's especially bad since the way they are tracking who pays what is completely blackboxed and I seem to remember reading another article saying that it's based on 'estimates.' It does seem pretty insane considering that there is just far easier and far more obvious way to ask for money which is to just get the revenue sheets and that's something easy for either side to fake.  
To top it all off it really feels like what they're giving in return for taking all this extra money is simply not worth it. Their latest features are all about their AI to help make the game for you from which I've seen, no one in their customer-base actually wants.
