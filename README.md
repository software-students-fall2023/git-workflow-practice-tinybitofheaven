This will have a **big** impact on game developemnt but also a lot of other general software development also. Game developers use a lot of external software in order to better integrate their processes and piplines into Unity Engine and if Unity becomes a liability for companies and indie devs to use these other software will also experience negative impacts. There really isn't an alternative game engine that fulfills the role Unity has had so far in the game development industry and even if they rollback these changes, they really did break their userbase's trust which will have long lasting impacts in the future.

I think that it's especially bad since the way they are tracking who pays what is completely blackboxed and I seem to remember reading another article saying that it's based on 'estimates.' It does seem pretty insane considering that there is just far easier and far more obvious way to ask for money which is to just get the revenue sheets and that's something easy for either side to fake.  
To top it all off it really feels like what they're giving in return for taking all this extra money is simply not worth it. Their latest features are all about their AI to help make the game for you from which I've seen, no one in their customer-base actually wants.

It was reported that CEO John Riccitiello sold 2000 shares of the company shortly before the announcement (along with some others on the board selling shares). Allegedly the changes are only going to affect 10% of their clients, and will not affect free games. There are concerns about studios being charged for pirated content (it seems like Unity would have little incentive to make an effort to protect developers from such). I definetely agree with Ryan that it seems excessive in contrast to new features that they're offering, not to mention the downside of negative reception that they could see coming.
